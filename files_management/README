## Scripts Overview

### 1. `copy_old_file.py`

## Functionality
- Reads content from the source file.
- Appends the content to each target file.

## Usage
Run the script using the command:

```bash
`python3 copy_old_file.py`
```
#### Example
- To use the script, modify the `source_file` and `target_files` variables in the script:

```python3
`source_file: str = 'source.txt'`
`target_files: List[str] = ['target1.txt', 'target2.txt']`
```

### 2. `create_new_file.py`

This script creates new Python files with a specified shebang line and sets execution permissions.

## Functionality
- Creates a new file(s) and writes the specified shebang line.
- Sets execution permissions for the created file.

## Usage
Run the script using the command:

```bash
python create_new_file.py
```
#### Example
- To create new files, modify the `file_list` variable in the script:

```python3
`file_list: List[str] = ['new_script.py']`
```

### 3. `delete_old_file.py`

This script deletes specified files from the filesystem.

## Functionality
- Deletes the files listed in the provided file paths.

## Usage
Run the script using the command:

```bash
python delete_old_file.py
```

#### Example
